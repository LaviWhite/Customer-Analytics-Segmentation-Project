**Background:**

To what extent does a platformâ€™s acquisition channel influence the learning outcomes of students?

Are there any geographical locations where most of students discover the platform, specifically through social media platforms like YouTube or Facebook?

In my upcoming project, I will be diving into real-world customer data to carry out market segmentation, a vital task for businesses aiming to grasp customer behavior and enhance marketing effectiveness. 
This project will entail various stages such as data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, applying clustering algorithms like k-means and hierarchical clustering, and interpreting the outcomes. Through the Customer Segmentation in Marketing with Python project, I aim to uncover the intricacies of customer behavior and pinpoint specific segments that can be addressed with tailored marketing approaches.
